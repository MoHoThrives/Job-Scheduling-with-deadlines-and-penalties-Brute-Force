Classes: Main, Job, JobConfiguration(extends Comparable)

Main:Lists the main procedures that are supposed to be done to get to the final answer.


1. Get the jobs, its time, penalty, and deadline. Put the jobs in an array; Job jobs[numJobs]. Assign each job  a letter in alphabetical order.

2. Have an array, String permutations[factorial(numJobs)] to store the permutations you will walk through.

3. For every permutation, create an instance of JobConfiguration, with the instance JobConfiguration(Job[], String permutation)

4. Loop through all the job configurations and keep track of the value with the lowest penalty

5. Output to console the final Job Configuration.



Job: A class to store the time, penalty, and deadline of the Jobs.

JobConfiguration: Makes a job configuration from the order of jobs given. Instantiated with the String of the Configuration, and the array of jobs. Gets a value for the total penalty; know how to calculate that. Make sure you have a calculatePenalty and a compareTo method.
